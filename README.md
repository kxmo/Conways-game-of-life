# Conway's game of life

## TL;DR:
### What
This is an implementation of Conway's game of life written in Java 8.

### Why
I have made or contributed to a variety of projects, some of which use databases, GUIs, web interfaces, CLIs, custom data structures, and so on but no project where I have contributed to all of the above.
This project is a (rather artificial) attempt to have as many elements of a "real world application" as I can in one place.

### Where
The project is currently hosted on Github.

### When
Projects like this are never truly finished - there's always one more feature to add.

### How
1. Install a Java runtime that supports Java 8
2. Download the source code (this repository)
3. Compile the program
4. Execute the program
5. Set up a game of life

### Who
Me, and maybe you!
Currently the project has been written in it's entirety by me.
You are welcome to submit patches or suggestions in any way that suits you (as with all of my projects).
If you like I will add your name to this README or a list of contributors, or you can add it yourself in your patch.
